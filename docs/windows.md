# Native Windows development

Install Windows Rustup, Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools with the Desktop development
with C++ workload and Windows SDK, Git for Windows, and Python 3.11+ with the `py`
launcher. Keep the checkout on your Windows drive and open a new PowerShell
terminal after installing Rust. The repository selects Rust 1.98.1 automatically.

From the application directory:

```powershell
rustc -vV
cargo --version
.\scripts\windows.ps1 cargo build --locked
# Create .env only if it does not already exist, then review its settings.
if (-not (Test-Path .env)) { Copy-Item .env.example .env }
.\scripts\windows.ps1 scripts/dev.sh up
.\scripts\windows.ps1 scripts/dev.sh migrate
.\scripts\windows.ps1 scripts/dev.sh run
```

The launcher uses native Windows Cargo and Git Bash. It does not invoke Windows'
legacy `bash.exe` launcher, which starts WSL. It supplies `python3` through the
Windows Python launcher and places build outputs in `target/native-windows`
unless `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` is already set. It restores the caller's environment and
working directory afterward.
It selects up to sixteen, eight, four, or two compiler jobs according to free memory and
uses the bundled LLVM linker for native Windows x64. Explicit Cargo settings are
preserved; set `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS` to choose concurrency or `BRACEL_LINKER=msvc`
to use Microsoft's linker. See [build performance](https://github.com/4H1R/bracel/blob/a21259d0bd21e489804cf062858da767db1bd55d/starter/docs/build-performance.md) for
profile choices, measurements and fallback behavior.

Quote Cargo's argument separator when calling through PowerShell, for example:
`.\scripts\windows.ps1 cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features '--' -D warnings`.

## Build feedback

Use `.\scripts\windows.ps1 cargo check --locked` while editing, or
`.\scripts\windows.ps1 cargo build --locked --bin bracel-starter` when you need a
runnable development binary. Reserve `--release` for optimized builds: the release
profile enables ThinLTO, which adds optimization work across libraries.

Keep the same `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` between builds to reuse compiled dependencies.
The build metadata script watches the selected lockfile and existing source paths;
watching a nonexistent alternative lockfile or dependency build script makes Cargo
rebuild the application even when nothing changed. Verify the cache with:

```powershell
.\scripts\windows.ps1 py -3 scripts/check-build-cache.py --release
```

This builds once, repeats the command, and fails if the unchanged build recompiles
any target. It prints measured times and rebuilt targets as JSON.

On Windows x86-64 without NASM, the launcher selects the pinned AWS-LC
dependency's bundled assembly objects unless you configured an explicit value.
The development/test profile keeps line-number backtraces; use `--profile
dev-full` for full debugger information or `--profile release-fast` for faster
optimized iteration. Shipping builds continue to use `--release`.

The [benchmark guide](https://github.com/4H1R/bracel/blob/a21259d0bd21e489804cf062858da767db1bd55d/starter/docs/build-performance.md#measurements) records clean builds,
unchanged builds, edited builds and the commands needed to repeat them.

To run tests, set `TEST_DATABASE_URL` to a disposable PostgreSQL database and run
`.\scripts\windows.ps1 cargo test --locked --all-targets --all-features`.

Rust builds and the server run as Windows processes. Compose starts PostgreSQL
and Mailpit through Docker Desktop; Docker may still use WSL internally for those
Linux containers. You can also configure `.env` to connect to native Windows
PostgreSQL and an SMTP service. Deployment-image checks require a Linux container
engine. Linux CI and the full shell acceptance suite are separate from native
Windows build/runtime verification.

## Verification scope

On 2026-09-27, the reference framework workspace passed its native Windows
all-feature build, all 45 Rust tests, formatting, Clippy, dependency-policy
checks, and nine real-process HTTP/database assertions. The Windows application
handled migrations, health/readiness, registration, authenticated profile access,
logout, and token revocation. The full shell distribution suite and Linux
container checks have a separate verification scope; Windows is not yet a CI
target.
