# Ready-to-use API accounts

The starter owns `src/features/accounts/` and the `users` migration. Bracel supplies bearer verification, hashed token storage, HTTP policies and the optional SMTP adapter. No application user table or route is added to the framework library.

Copy `.env.example`, run `bash scripts/dev.sh up`, `bash scripts/dev.sh migrate`, then `bash scripts/dev.sh run`. Local authentication, enabled accounts and disabled teaching routes are the starter defaults even when those environment settings are omitted. PostgreSQL and local Mailpit start through Compose. In a second terminal run `bash scripts/dev.sh auth:mail-work` to deliver verification and password reset emails. Inspect local mail at `http://127.0.0.1:8025`; this is developer tooling, not an application frontend.

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/auth/register \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"email":"you@example.test","display_name":"Your name","password":"a long unique password"}'
# Read data.access_token from the response; pass it as Authorization: Bearer TOKEN.
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/users/me -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

| Method and path | JSON input | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /api/auth/register` | `email`, `display_name`, `password` | 201, `data.user`, `data.access_token`, `token_type`, `expires_in` |
| `POST /api/auth/login` | `email`, `password` | 200, same session response |
| `GET /api/users/me` | Bearer credential | 200, current user's ID, email, display name and `email_verified` |
| `PATCH /api/users/me` | Bearer credential and `display_name` | 200, updated profile |
| `POST /api/auth/logout` | Bearer credential | 204, current session revoked |
| `POST /api/auth/logout-all` | Bearer credential | 204, all this account's sessions revoked |
| `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` | `email` | 202, identical acknowledgement for existing and missing accounts |
| `POST /api/auth/reset-password` | `token`, `password` | 204, replace password and revoke every account session |
| `POST /api/auth/email-verification` | Bearer credential; no body required | 202, queue verification for the current email, or acknowledge an already verified email |
| `POST /api/auth/verify-email` | Bearer credential and `token` | 204, verify current email and consume the token |

Responses use `Data<T>` and shared problem details; account responses carry `Cache-Control: no-store`. Validation collects missing, wrongly typed and invalid fields into one `issues` array. Unknown fields use `unrecognized_keys` at the root path `[]`; duplicate JSON fields are rejected. Submitted values are never echoed. Email addresses are trimmed and ASCII-normalized to lowercase with database uniqueness. Passwords are never trimmed; accept 15–128 Unicode characters, with a 512-byte bound. Argon2id uses the RustCrypto 0.5 defaults (19 MiB, two iterations, one lane), random salts, and a four-operation blocking-work limit per router. Unknown-user login performs equivalent password-hashing work and returns the same invalid-credentials detail. Database errors and hashes never enter public DTOs or logs.

Sessions are 256-bit random opaque bearer credentials, hashed in `bracel_tokens`, and linked to users in `account_sessions`. They expire after one day. Logout is checked against PostgreSQL on subsequent requests across replicas. Login and reset serialize on the user row so a login verified against an old password cannot issue a token after reset. There is no refresh credential: log in again after expiration. Send credentials only over HTTPS outside local development.

`AUTH_MODE=local` makes these tokens available to normal Bracel scope-protected routes. Issued users receive only `account:self`. Add application permissions deliberately in `accounts/application.rs::session`, and use the verified principal plus owner/tenant predicates in each feature. Registering does not grant administrative, example-note, or optional package scopes. The account handlers additionally require the local issuer and a matching user; an external issuer's matching subject cannot access them. `AUTH_MODE=bearer` continues to select external JWTs for other resources; account endpoints independently accept local sessions. `AUTH_MODE=off` preserves anonymous teaching mode, while account profile/logout endpoints still require authentication. Cookies are not accepted.

`ENABLE_ACCOUNTS=false` removes account routes (also explicitly select `AUTH_MODE=off` or `bearer`); retain the migration history. `ALLOW_REGISTRATION=false` closes registration while keeping existing users able to log in. There is no public user directory, arbitrary user update/delete, email-change workflow, authenticated password-change endpoint, MFA, social login or breached-password lookup.

## Email verification

Registration returns `email_verified=false`. When mail is configured, it commits a verification intent in `account_verifications` in the same transaction as the new user and session. Without mail, registration still works and remains unverified; configure mail and request verification later. Existing users receive a null `email_verified_at` when migration `000007` is applied. The migration never assumes ownership of an existing email address.

The worker delivers a `Verification token` for the JSON confirmation flow. Submit it with the account's bearer credential:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/auth/verify-email \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"token":"TOKEN_FROM_EMAIL"}'
```

Verification credentials contain 256 random bits, are stored only as hashes, expire 15 minutes after the request and are consumed once. Confirmation checks the current user and the email captured by the intent. Another user's token, a reset token, an expired token or a superseded token returns 400. Concurrent confirmations allow exactly one success. Resend uses the stored email, accepts no recipient override and allows three requests per email per 15-minute window across replicas. An already verified user receives 202 without creating another intent. Missing mail configuration returns 503 for resend.

Confirmation sets `email_verified_at`; responses expose only the boolean `email_verified`. It is visible through existing sessions on every replica. Verification does not grant scopes or revoke sessions. Use `CurrentUser` and check `user.email_verified` in application operations that require email ownership. Registration/login/profile remain available before verification. Any future email-change workflow must clear verification and invalidate outstanding intents atomically.

## Current-user helper

Accept `CurrentUser(user): CurrentUser` from `features::accounts` on a route registered with `RoutePolicy::Scope("account:self")`. It resolves the verified local principal to an existing user; the shipped profile endpoint uses this extractor. External JWT callers can extract `bracel::identity::Principal` directly. See [helpers](helpers.md#current-user-and-principal).

## Account mail delivery and operations

Mail is enabled in the starter's default Cargo features; the framework adapter remains optional. `--no-default-features` retains accounts/login but requires enabling `mail` for reset and verification delivery. Without configured mail, forgot-password returns the same 503 for every address.

Local delivery uses `MAIL_LOCAL_PORT=1025` and `MAIL_FROM`. Production removes `MAIL_LOCAL_PORT` and sets `MAIL_SMTP_HOST`, `MAIL_SMTP_USERNAME`, `MAIL_SMTP_PASSWORD`, and an approved `MAIL_FROM`. The relay uses TLS with certificate validation; plaintext delivery is limited to loopback. Configure provider/domain SPF, DKIM and DMARC separately.

Forgot-password commits a reset intent in `account_resets`, without a raw token. `auth:mail-work` claims pending intents using PostgreSQL leases and SKIP LOCKED, generates a secret in memory, persists its hash, and sends a plain-text email with an HTML alternative. The message contains a token for the client's JSON reset flow; no HTML reset page or client-supplied redirect URL exists. A token expires 15 minutes after its request and can be consumed once. A new request supersedes earlier requests. Each delivery retry generates a fresh token and invalidates the previous attempt; in an ambiguous SMTP failure an earlier email may contain a superseded token. Only the latest delivered token works. Five attempts, a 30-second retry interval, and a 30-second lease bound delivery; permanent SMTP rejection stops retries. Relay acceptance is not proof of inbox delivery.

The same worker handles verification intents with the same lease, retry and expiration rules; resets take priority. `auth:mail-work` initializes configuration and its SMTP transport once and reuses them for subsequent deliveries. Restart it after changing mail configuration. `auth:mail-once` processes one item. Monitor pending/expired intents, attempts and worker health using database/operations tooling; these commands never print message bodies or credentials. After a delivery problem is fixed, the user can request another email. Run `auth:cleanup` periodically; each invocation removes up to 1000 expired reset intents, verification intents, quota buckets and expired/revoked account credentials per table. Quotas count attempts per normalized-email hash across replicas: 10 logins, 5 registrations, 3 forgot requests and 3 verification resends per 15-minute window. Existing HTTP peer/write quotas also apply; use edge limits for distributed IP abuse controls. Registration returns 409 for a duplicate email and therefore discloses availability; forgot/login use generic outcomes. No hard account lockout is installed.

## Verification

`bash scripts/accounts-e2e.sh` requires disposable `TEST_DATABASE_URL` and runs the real binary, migrations, HTTP clients, multiple replicas and a local SMTP peer. It retains a repeatable JSON report, redacted transcript, logs and source/binary/lock hashes under `.scratch/accounts-e2e/<run>/`. The root and standalone check scripts run it.
