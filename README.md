# Bracel starter

[Framework](https://github.com/4H1R/bracel) · [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) · [HTTP conventions](https://github.com/4H1R/bracel/blob/a21259d0bd21e489804cf062858da767db1bd55d/starter/docs/http.md) · [Capability catalog](https://github.com/4H1R/bracel/blob/a21259d0bd21e489804cf062858da767db1bd55d/starter/docs/features/index.md) · [Middleware and helpers](docs/helpers.md)

A Bracel application on Axum + SeaORM + PostgreSQL, with [API user accounts](docs/accounts.md), shared query filters, cursor pagination and [route middleware](https://github.com/4H1R/bracel/blob/a21259d0bd21e489804cf062858da767db1bd55d/starter/docs/middleware.md). Registration, login, profile endpoints, logout, queued password resets and email verification are included. PostgreSQL is required; password reset delivery uses SMTP. [Included batteries](https://github.com/4H1R/bracel/blob/a21259d0bd21e489804cf062858da767db1bd55d/starter/docs/batteries.md) cover CRUD generation, validated requests, testing, commands, durable jobs/scheduling, external JWT verification and revocable machine tokens. The starter enables mail and a shared local cache by default; storage, compression, outbound HTTP and tracing remain opt-in Cargo features. Middleware defaults, current-user extraction, job handlers and application schedules have dedicated [customization files](docs/helpers.md).

The framework is a dependency; this repository owns features, migrations, state and deployment. In the framework workspace it uses a local path; standalone releases pin an exact Git revision of the public MIT-licensed repository. Build the standalone image with `bash scripts/build-image.sh`: it vendors locked sources outside Docker and builds without network access or credentials in image layers. No crates.io publication is implied.

## Run locally

Prerequisites: Rust via rustup (the repository installs/selects 1.98.1), a C compiler/linker, Bash, diff, OpenSSL CLI for container-test tokens, and Docker with Compose. Windows users can use the native MSVC toolchain and [PowerShell launcher](docs/windows.md). Linux is the deployment and CI platform; native Windows builds are checked locally. The email exercise additionally uses Python 3 and curl.

See [build performance](https://github.com/4H1R/bracel/blob/a21259d0bd21e489804cf062858da767db1bd55d/starter/docs/build-performance.md) for measured clean/edit timings,
the `dev-full` debugging profile, and the `release-fast` iteration profile.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
bash scripts/dev.sh up
bash scripts/dev.sh migrate
bash scripts/dev.sh run
```

Local bearer accounts are the default, and teaching routes are off. The example environment also configures local mail. `.env` is sourced as shell configuration by the development script; the binary itself only reads process environment. Only source trusted local files. Run `bash scripts/dev.sh auth:mail-work` in another terminal for password resets and email verification; local Mailpit is at `http://127.0.0.1:8025`.

In another terminal:

```bash
curl -i http://127.0.0.1:3000/healthz
curl -i http://127.0.0.1:3000/readyz
curl -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"email":"you@example.test","display_name":"Your name","password":"a long unique password"}' \
  http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/auth/register
# Set TOKEN to data.access_token from the response:
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/users/me
```

`healthz` checks the process; `readyz` queries the migrated database. Ctrl-C drains in-flight requests. `bash scripts/dev.sh down` stops dependencies and retains the database volume.

## Check your changes

Inspect configuration and application structure without changing the database:

```bash
bash scripts/dev.sh doctor
bash scripts/dev.sh inspect --json
bash scripts/dev.sh doctor --json --database
```

Database checks are opt-in. `doctor --deploy --database` also rejects enabled teaching routes; run it with the intended deployment environment. [Developer tooling](https://github.com/4H1R/bracel/blob/a21259d0bd21e489804cf062858da767db1bd55d/starter/docs/features/tooling.md) documents JSON output, exit codes and limits.

```bash
cargo install cargo-deny --version 0.20.2 --locked
export TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgres://starter:starter@127.0.0.1:5432/starter
bash scripts/check.sh
bash scripts/container-smoke.sh
```

Database tests create random isolated schemas and remove them after success; use a disposable database. Checks fail if the database is absent. CI runs these same scripts. [Quality policy](docs/quality.md) explains the supported configurations and required hosting settings. [Verification record](https://github.com/4H1R/bracel/blob/a21259d0bd21e489804cf062858da767db1bd55d/starter/docs/verification.md) distinguishes observed results from instructions.

## Make this your project

1. Copy or use this repository as a template. Keep `Cargo.lock`, `rust-toolchain.toml`, and `STARTER_VERSION`. Initialize a new Git repository if needed. Change the package name in `Cargo.toml`; update the Rust crate imports in `src/main.rs`, `src/bin/openapi.rs`, and `tests/http.rs`, plus binary/image names in scripts and Dockerfile. Run `cargo check` to refresh the lockfile package entry, then run the checks.
2. Follow [architecture](docs/architecture.md): replace `src/features/notes/`, its route registration in `src/http/mod.rs`, tests, and OpenAPI annotations with your first feature. For a fresh, unused database, replace the teaching migrations. For a database already in use, append migrations instead of editing history. Also change the readiness query to the schema your application requires. Remove `ENABLE_EXAMPLE` once the teaching routes are gone.
3. Read `AGENTS.md`, the [catalog](https://github.com/4H1R/bracel/blob/a21259d0bd21e489804cf062858da767db1bd55d/starter/docs/features/index.md), and the relevant recipe. Ask, for example: **“Add durable email notifications for newly created notes using the linked email and jobs guides. Store the note and delivery intent atomically, test retries and duplicate delivery, and document the application's behavior and verification.”**
4. Record the source URL and source commit in `STARTER_VERSION` when adopting the starter. Tag your initial import. Keep an optional `starter` Git remote and review future upstream diffs; cherry-pick reviewed changes rather than overwriting your application. Re-run all checks after dependency, migration, or recipe updates.

The [architecture decision](https://github.com/4H1R/bracel/blob/a21259d0bd21e489804cf062858da767db1bd55d/starter/docs/adr/0001-stack.md) explains why this uses Axum rather than Loco. [HTTP](https://github.com/4H1R/bracel/blob/a21259d0bd21e489804cf062858da767db1bd55d/starter/docs/http.md), [database](docs/database.md), and [operations](docs/operations.md) describe the core. Configure [bearer authentication](https://github.com/4H1R/bracel/blob/a21259d0bd21e489804cf062858da767db1bd55d/starter/docs/features/identity.md#implemented-bearer-access-tokens) for API clients. The notes example has shared read/write scopes, not per-user ownership or tenant isolation, and no hosted deployment is configured.

## Framework guides

Application guidance and API contracts live in `docs/`. Shared guides and historical reports live in the framework repository. Standalone exports pin those links to the framework revision in `STARTER_VERSION`; update them when upgrading that dependency.

Application-specific conventions belong in this project's docs and `.ai/rules`.
